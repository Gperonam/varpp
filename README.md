# varpp a Variant Classifier for genetic variants.

With the advent of NGS we have access to vast amounts of scientific research information. Multiple databases have emerged as a repository for this information, sorted 
and classified in multiple ways. Genetics has been one of the areas of life sciences that has seen the greatest expansion in the type of data. The study of genetic 
variants brings us ever closer to the realization of an increasingly patient-centered medicine. Huge libraries of genetic variants have been generated and only a few 
search tools have been developed; for this, a common classification protocol emerged in the scientific society by the ACMG. There are very few computer tools that 
automate the task of classifying these variants, which is why in this thesis we have developed a classification script that combines the efforts of the ACMG and several 
researchers to generate an open and freely accessible code to classify variants based on current scientific evidence. Finally, it has been integrated into a web 
application that allows the user to classify any variant in a simple and effective way.
